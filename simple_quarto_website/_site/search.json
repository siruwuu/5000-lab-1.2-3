For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes‚Äô theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately by conditioning it relative to their age, rather than assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.\nBased on Bayes law both the prevalence of a disease in a given population and the error rate of an infectious disease test have to be taken into account to evaluate the meaning of a positive test result correctly and avoid the base-rate fallacy.

His book, Theory of Probability, which was first published in 1939, played an important role in the revival of the objective Bayesian view of probability.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nConditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) is already known to have occurred.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nPosterior probability is a type of conditional probability that results from updating the prior probability with information summarized by the likelihood via an application of Bayes‚Äô rule.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nLikelihood function (often simply called the likelihood) measures how well a statistical model explains observed data by calculating the probability of seeing that data under different parameter values of the model.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nPrior probability distribution of an uncertain quantity, often simply called the prior, is its assumed probability distribution before some evidence is taken into account.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nMarginal distribution of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset.‚Ü©Ô∏é"
